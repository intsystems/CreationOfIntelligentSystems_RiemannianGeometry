abstract = {The use of spatial covariance matrix as a feature is investigated for motor imagery EEG-based classification in brain–computer interface applications. A new kernel is derived by establishing a connection with the Riemannian geometry of symmetric positive definite matrices. Different kernels are tested, in combination with support vector machines, on a past BCI competition dataset. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms significantly state of the art results, effectively replacing the traditional spatial filtering approach.}

  abstract      = {Intracranial human recordings are a valuable and rare resource of information about the brain. Making such data publicly available not only helps tackle reproducibility issues in science, it helps make more use of these valuable data. This is especially true for data collected using naturalistic tasks. Here, we describe a dataset collected from a large group of human subjects while they watched a short audiovisual film. The dataset has several unique features. First, it includes a large amount of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data (51 participants, age range of 5–55 years, who all performed the same task). Second, it includes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings (30 participants, age range of 7–47) during the same task. Eighteen participants performed both iEEG and fMRI versions of the task, non-simultaneously. Third, the data were acquired using a rich audiovisual stimulus, for which we provide detailed speech and video annotations. This dataset can be used to study neural mechanisms of multimodal perception and language comprehension, and similarity of neural signals across brain recording modalities.},
